				<p>
					We offer team building with a focus on fitness.
				</p>
				<p>
					We bring fun, adventure and a great opportunity to forge bonds with your workmates, through trail hikes, games and sports. Our transformational outdoor experience is designed to energize, motivate and coalesce your team members. We aim to harness, build and instil improved communication between individuals and teams alike. Focusing on teamwork will put in spark in individuals who may be otherwise exhausted, tired, stressed and unmotivated. Team building is not limited to just corporates - even groups of friends and family who just want to spend time together having fun outdoors are welcome and can benefit too. 
				</p>
				<p>
					TipwaTipwa Fitness promotes healthy living and wellbeing across all ages, so ultimately our hope is that the individuals who participate in our Team Building sessions, would incorporate fitness as part of their lifestyle, and live healthy.

					<h6> SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages. </h6>
						<p>
							While the goals within SDG3 may be more specific, TipwaTipwa encompasses a holistic approach to these goals in promoting purposely living an active lifestyle. A lifestyle that incorporates regular sessions of activity to curb a sedentary alternative, good eating habits that feed, replenish and fuel our bodies appropriately, is both repeatable and sustainable. When these are applied to individuals, groups and families alike, the resultant healthier community is an end goal for TipwaTipwa and SDG 3.

						<p>					
							TipwaTipwa is keen on supporting and developing sustainable tourism that creates jobs, promotes local culture and products. We use local guides when we hike and support the local communities by purchasing gift items from them and eating our meals at local eateries, thus promoting local businesses. We substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, e.g. no plastic bottles on hikes, reduction, recycling and reusing on said hikes, various activities and events.

					<h6> SDG 15: Life on land. </h6>
						<p>					
							We play our bit to ensure the conservation of ecosystems on the mountains and trails we hike. As well, we promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halting deforestation, restoring degraded forests and substantially increasing afforestation, by staying on existing trails and paths and dispersing seeds or planting indigenous trees to the hike area while out on the trails.
